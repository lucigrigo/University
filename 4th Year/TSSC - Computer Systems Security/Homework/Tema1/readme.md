# Introduction to Computer Security - Assignment 1

Deadline: please see curs.upb.ro !

## Personalization

Please download your personalized homework from [https://isc2022.1337.cx].
Enter your Moodle username (WITHOUT the email domain or '@').
Example: "florin.stoian".

This will generate a customized archive with the tasks (for your eyes, only :P).

## Homework Description

The homework contains 3 tasks:

  - `task1`: cryptography, 0.66p
  - `task2`: linux access control (remote container), 0.67p
  - `task3`: binary exploit, 0.67p

Each task challenges you to find a "flag", a string with the form
`SpeishFlag{<random hash>}` (internal joke: we - some of the ISC members - went
to Amsterdam 4 years ago, though we didn't find any 'speish' :D ).
There is a single flag per task: if you got one with the appropriate syntax, it
will be accepted as the correct solution (please take care when decoding or
manually copying it, e.g. zero vs 'o').

WARNING: the flag is case sensitive! Please copy the whole string (including the
`SpeishFlag{...}` decorator) into the solution file!

Note that all tasks require Internet connectivity.
You may want to experiment locally, if possible (e.g., crypto attack on dummy
data or using gdb with a local binary).

WARNING: any unauthorized cyber-attack (especially Denial of Service) on the
assignment's infrastructure is strictly forbidden!

Your final solution will be in the form of a ZIP archive containing the
following files (INSIDE THE ARCHIVE'S ROOT, PLEASE!!):

  - `flag1`: flag for the first task (crypto attack);
  - `flag2`: flag for the second task (linux acl);
  - `flag3`: flag for the third task (binary exploit);
  - `username.txt`: your username (the same as you entered inside the homework
    archive generator webpage)!
  - `readme.txt`: for each task, briefly describe your approach (keep it short,
    please!);
  - any custom scripts you coded for solving the homework (please don't include
    third party tools, link them in your readme instead).

Please keep the file names as above and available inside the archive's
root directory!

The solution archive must be uploaded to Moodle (https://curs.upb.ro) BEFORE the
deadline!

Note: an automated checker is not included because it is unnecessary: if you
discover the (solely) hidden flag for a task and it has the form mentioned
above, it most certainly will be the correct one and you will get the points (we
also manually check them for typos, though take care when copying them).

If you have any questions, please use the Moodle forum and/or the Teams channel.

GLHF!
