# Crypto Strikes Back!

Hello, mighty hacker!

Once again, we require your skills for decoding an important message we received
from one of our undercover agents, along with some code.

Please see the attached files.

We also found a remote server which gladly accepts the message, but we don't
know what it means... just try it yourself with netcat, you'll know what to do:
`isc2022.1337.cx:11048`

Good luck!


### Hints:

  - first, identify the encoding & cipher used!
  - unfortunately, you cannot crack the private key :P (so... no bruteforcing!)
  - server errors will be your blessing ;)
  - pay attention to what the server gives you back!
  - in case of emergency, break this: "KLT vahlxg vbiaxkmxqm tmmtvd"
  - and here's good one: "eqqmp ttt.vlrqryb.zlj txqze?s aNt4t9TdUzN"
